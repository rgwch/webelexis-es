# Models

This folder contains data models for use in Webelexis. Each file has a xxFactory to create objects of a given type, and  a class of the type itself,
which is primarly syntactic sugar around a FHIR_Resource. All types are derived from fhirobj.ts.

The basic data model of the FIR-Resources used is defined in fhir.ts.
